PDF Handler GUI - Explanation

This GUI provides a user-friendly interface to manage two main scripts for handling PDF files. Below is an explanation of each script and how to use the GUI:


---

### 1. PDF Unlocking Script
This script unlocks password-protected PDFs using a list of passwords provided in the `.env` file.

#### How It Works:
- The script reads PDF files from the folder specified in the `.env` file (`INPUT_FOLDER_PATH_LOCKED_FILES`).
- It attempts to unlock each PDF using the passwords listed in the `.env` file (`PASSWORDS`).
- Unlocked PDFs are saved to the folder specified in the `.env` file (`OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH_UNLOCKED_FILES`).

#### Usage:
- Place your password-protected PDFs in the input folder.
- Make sure that the name of each PDF file is exactly as you want the watermark to be on it.
--Example: "Salary_February_2025".pdf
- Add the passwords to the `.env` file as a comma-separated list.
- Run the script to unlock the PDFs.

#### Demo .env file (should look like this):
INPUT_FOLDER_PATH_LOCKED_FILES=C:\Users\username\Desktop\payslips
OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH_UNLOCKED_FILES=C:\Users\username\Desktop\no_password
PASSWORDS=password1,password2,password3
OUTPUT_FOLDER_FOR_COMBINED_FILE=C:\Users\username\Desktop\combined_file

- *In this case the user changed his passwords for the files and want to unlock all the files with his previews passwords as well.

### 2. PDF Combining Script
This script combines multiple unlocked PDFs into a single PDF file and adds a watermark to each page.

#### How It Works:
- The script reads unlocked PDFs from the folder specified in the `.env` file (`OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH_UNLOCKED_FILES`).
- It creates a watermark for each PDF using the filename as the watermark text.
- The script combines all PDFs into a single file and saves it to the folder specified in the `.env` file (`OUTPUT_FOLDER_FOR_COMBINED_FILE`).

#### Usage:
- Ensure the unlocked PDFs are in the correct folder.
- Run the script to combine the PDFs and add watermarks.

### Notes
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured with the required paths and passwords.
- Add the `.env` file to `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive information.
